CQ1: In your own words, with your own example, explain this property of exponents.
    Multiplying the number by itself "power" times.
CQ2: In your own words, with your own example, explain this property of exponents.
        Multiplying the number to the multiplication of both powers
CQ3:  For the formula 7*n + 2*n4 + 5, what is the appropriate Theta?
    n^4
CQ4:  For the formula 7*n5 + 2*n3 + 5, what is the appropriate Theta?
    n^5
CQ5:  For the formula (2*n + 3)*(4*n + 2), what is the appropriate Theta? (Hint:  multiply it out first!
    n^2
CQ6:  For the formula 7*n + 2*4n + 5, what is the appropriate Theta?
    4^n
CQ7:  For the formula 100*2n + 7*3n + 17, what is the appropriate Theta?
    3^n
CQ8:  Consider the following code:

int s = 4*3 + 6*7 + 8*9;        // 3 multiplications
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {   // loop n times
    s += 5*(4*i + 2);           //   2 multiplications
}

How can we describe the number of multiplications, with Theta?
    n since we loop n times

CQ9:  Consider the following pseudocode:

loop n times      // first loop
  7 multiplications
loop n times      // outer loop
  loop n times    //   inner loop
    8 multiplications

How can we describe the number of multiplications, with Theta?
    n^2 since we have nested for loop of n

5 multiplications
loop n times  
    between 3 and 6 multiplications
loop n times  
    loop n times 
        between 4 and 7 multiplications
    loop between n/2 and n times  
        at most 3 multiplications
    loop 2*n times  
        loop 3*n times  
            between 2 and 5 multiplications
loop n times 
    loop n times 
        4 multiplications
    loop between n/3 and n/2 times 
        between 6 and 12 multiplications

How can we describe the number of multiplications, with Theta?
    the first loop gives us n, the second nested loop gives us n^2
    and the third nested loop gives us n^2 so we can simplify to
    2n^2

CQ11:  For the formula 7*v + 9*v2 + 2*e, what is the appropriate Theta?
    v^2+e 

CQ12:  For the formula 7*v + 9*e2 + 2*e, what is the appropriate Theta?
    v+e^2

CQ13:  In the panA algorithm, assuming the input graph has v vertices and e edges, how many times will we reach the if statement in the find_min() function, total (described with Theta)?  Explain your answer.
    v^2 since we would go through the whole graph each time it is called and
    it is called v times, which results in v^2
CQ14:  In the panA algorithm, assuming the input graph has v vertices and e edges, how many times will we reach the first if statement in the recompute_warn_values() function, total (described with Theta)?  Explain your answer.
    It would be v * e^v since we would go through the whole graph and for each
    node, we would go through the whole graph again to recompute warn values. So,
    we have v calls for each node, then e^v visits to each neighbor, thus we have
    v*e^v
