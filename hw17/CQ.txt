Exercise 5:  In your own words (using about three sentences), justify case 3 of the Master Theorem (assuming that the important quantity is the number of recursive calls). 
    In case three we know that d is less than log_b(a). Because of this,
    we know that as n goes to infinity, the exponential part of O(alogb(n)) would
    overtake everything else in the term. 

Exercise 6:  In your own words (using about three sentences), justify case 2 of the Master Theorem.
    In case two, d is equal to log_b(a) which results in O(n^dlog_b(n)), and because no n is bigger than the other
    we know that there exists an integer such that the right term multiplied by that integer would be greater than or equal to the
    left term.
