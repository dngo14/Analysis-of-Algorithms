What is the sum of the whole numbers from 1 to n?  (if n=4, this is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)
    n(n+1) / 2
Justify your answer mathematically, in a way that makes intuitive sense to you.
    How this makes sense to me is how many pairs you can make with a number from the set. So for each number, 
    it interacts with the other number at the end of the set. So say we have n = 4. We would group 1 and 4 which 
    is 5 then we would group 2 and 3 which is also 5. So if we multiply the two groups by the sum we get the answer.
    So we have n/2 groups for the pairing and then n+1 for the sum of each pair.
What is the sum of the powers of 2 from 1 to 2n?  (if n = 3, this is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15)
    2^n+1 - 1
Justify your answer mathematically, in a way that makes intuitive sense to you.
    How this makes sense to me is when we have a 2 raised to some power lets say 4, we get 2^4 = 16 then
    when we look at the sum of powers of 2^4 we get 31. Furthermore 31 is basically 32-1, but 2^5 = 32 so,
    thats how the equation 2^n+1 - 1 works since the sum of powers of two is less than the product of the next
    power.
