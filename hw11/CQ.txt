CQ1:  A) In the exercise r5 above (with two recursive calls 
inside the r5 function), what formula could we 
use to describe how many function calls would be made 
for r5(j), for some value j?
    Geometric sum formula with a ratio of 2 and starting value of 1, 
    where j is the height

B) In the exercise r5b above (with three recursive calls inside 
the r5b function), what formula could we use to describe how many 
function calls would be made for r5b(j), for some value j?
    Geometric sum formula with a ratio of 3 and starting value of 1, 
    where j is the height

C) If we had another recursive function r5c that had d recursive
calls (where d could be two, or three, or something larger), what formula could we use to describe how 
many function calls would be made for r5c(j), for some value j?
    Geometric sum formula with a ratio of d and starting value of 1, 
    where j is the height
